00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:03.000
Thanks for checking out Plyr.io

00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:06.000
These are just example VTT captions

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:09.000
Plyr is fully customisable 

00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:12.000
So you can match it to your designs 

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.000
Or just use this default theme

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:18.000
You can load everything cross-origin with CORS

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.000
And there's an API and events built in

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:24.000
Best of all it's just 5.7KB (gzipped)

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:34.000
